READ ME: This school project is a simple Python program that calculates an employee's weekly earnings based on their hourly wage and total hours worked. 
It prompts the user for their name, hourly rate, and hours worked, then computes and displays the total paycheck amount formatted to two decimal places.

employee_name = input("Enter your name: ")
hourly_rate_str = input(employee_name + ", what is your hourly rate? $")
hourly_rate = float(hourly_rate_str)
total_hours_str = input(employee_name + ", how many hours did you work this week? ")
total_hours = int(total_hours_str)
total_wages = hourly_rate * total_hours
print(employee_name + ", your check for this week should be $" + format(total_wages, ".2f"))
